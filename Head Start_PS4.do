**Most children who attended Head Start had less dad presense (50.3% vs. 71.7%),

**less proportion who attended some college (27% vs. 33%).

//Start on test scores? Be sure to explain the magnitude of the estimated effect.

**Going to Head Start decreases your score by 5 points on average, but the effects
**are not statistically significant. We also cannot conclude that signing up for
**head start is exogenous. These are decisions at the family level and most likely
**mean that children who were enrolled were enrolled for various reasons, and were
**most likley more prone to be falling behind in school compared to the avarage
**student.
**Additionally, Random Effects estimates have smaller standard errors, as expected,
**after RE efficiently reweights the variance of the between and within level variance.
**Assuming within family variation is smaller than betwee, the RE model will place
**less weight on between variation and more weight on within variation.

**With fixed effects, the new interpretation is that participating in Head Start
**decreases your 5-6 age test score by about 11.5 points compared to 5.5 before.
**Standard errors are correct because used brute force rather than finesse method.

//State the assumption necessary to interpret the fixed effects estimator as 
//causal. Can you think of some ways to test that assumption? If so, run the tests. 
//What do your tests suggest about the validity of the fixed effects estimator?

**In order to interpret the fixed effects estimator as appropriate, we need to assume 
**that the group-level error component is correlated with Head Start and test scores.

**In order to interpret the fixed effects estimator as causal, the covariance between
**the individual xi and the individual error term should equal the covariance of 
**the average individual xi and the individual error term.

**That there might be some unobserved family characteristics that are correlated
**with being in the Head Start program (such as being poorer).
**Because we believe that assignment of Head Start is conditioned on falling
**into a lower socioeconomic status, then family-level covariates are important,
**making fixed effects estimation appropriate.



**We can test this by seeing if certain socioeconomic characteristics are more 
**strongly correlated among siblings versus nonsiblings. 

**The test confirm that fixed effects estimator is the appropriate estimator.

//Some advocates for early-childhood education suggest that the effects of programs

//in later childhood, or do the effects fade out with age? Make sure you compare 
//results using comparable test-score units.
