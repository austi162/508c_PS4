**We also cannot conclude that signing up for head start is exogenous. These are 
**decisions at the family level and most likely mean that children who were enrolled 
**were enrolled for various reasons, and were most likley more prone to be falling 
**behind in school compared to the avarage student. 

**As a result, after clustering and running RE to account for serial correlation 
**within families, we find that Head Start still decreases test scores, although 
**the effect is still statistically insignificant at the 90% CI.

**Additionally, Random Effects estimates have smaller standard errors, as expected,
**as RE efficiently reweights the variance of the between and within level variance.
**Assuming within family variation is smaller than between, the RE model will place
**less weight on between variation and more weight on within variation.

**Interestingly, adding individual cognitive scores decreases the significance and
**implies that Head Start decreases test scores. This is statisticall insignificant
**at the 95% CI.

**To whether FE or RE is appropriate, we will run the Hausman test to determine 
**if the estimated coefficients are jointly significantly different from zero.

**We confirm that Fixed Effects is the appropriate model to use.
**Running the Hausman test, we reject the null hypothesis that B = 0. This means
**that the because B is not equal to zero, the covariance between the group level
**error term and  x_ij are also not equal to zero. This means that B from RE would 
**be an inconsistent estimator. Therefore, we will use FE.

**In order to interpret the fixed effects estimator as causal, the covariance between
**the individual xi and the individual error term should equal the covariance of 
**the average individual xi and the individual error term. To test this, I will
**compare the intentionally excluded IQ test score to test whether they are equal.

**Covariance between Head Start and the IQ test is -.75, and the covariance between
**mean Head Start within families and the IQ test is -.90, this implies that 
**FE may be an unbiased estimator. Still need to determine whether these two 
**covariances are statistically different. Can we conduct some sort of t-test?

**We can conduct Box's M Test to determine whether two covariance matrices are
**equal.
